## Overview of VS2DT

VS2DT (Variably Saturated 2-Dimensional Transport) is a graphical software package for simulating fluid flow and solute or energy transport in variably saturated porous media. The package is a modified version of the VS2DI (VS2D Interactive) package.

VS2DT is designed for use in applications such as: infiltration, seepage through dams and levees, ground-water recharge, evapotranspiration, solute transport, and energy transport. The program can simulate: (1) transient or steady-state flow and transport, (2) one- or two-dimensional problems in a vertical cross section or in a horizontal plane, (3) flow and transport in heterogeneous and anisotropic media, and (4) free surface (water table) boundaries.
